# A story about frontend development

[Thomas Coopman @tcoopman](https://www.twitter.com/tcoopman)

[Infinite Tree](https://infinitetree.eu)

???

On the backend we're moving away from the bbom. So why should we build one on the frontend?

Can we use the lessons learned on the frontend as well?

Using the lessons learned in backend development (services, microservices, decoupled)

What are reasons for services (scaling, not having the bbom, )

# Goal and disclaimer

???

I want interaction, discuss things with me

I have created and implemented some of these things,
Not all ideas are tested in production
There is no one correct solution
Experiment, test on your own, be critical

# So, you want to build a SPA???

Your backend is full of (micro)services. And your frontend is one big ball of mud?
Was that your goal?

I will also asume that your SPA is really one single application, after this talk,
we will see that this is not really a requirement of the SPA.


You don't have to build a SPA

Reasons why you would not want to build one:

* Techniques like turbolinks can make it fast (and you don't notice that you are not have a SPA)
* Building a SPA has a cost (everything needs server side validation and if you don't build an api...)
* Not everything needs to be dynamic (and if it needs to be dynamic, that doesn't mean SPA per se)

Ask who is building a SPA?

* What is your reason to build a SPA?

Not everyone is doing it

* NoRedInk (Elm)

Are you ready to bet on one framework
Can someone find missing frameworks?
A lot are missing (elm, bucklescript, reason)

# Techniques to prevent this

Split your SPA in apps
Every app has it's own responsibility
Every app can host an API
An app doesn't have to be frontend either, it can be mvc,php,whatever, it doesn't matter

# 3 (or 4) applications

* Header
* Menu
* Body
* (Container)

???

Insert code here (code examples)

# The obvious solution

  <link href="header.[hash].css" rel="stylesheet">
  <link href="menu.[hash].css" rel="stylesheet">
  <link href="body.[hash].css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>

<body>
	<div id="header"></div>
	<div id="menu"></div>
	<div id="body"></div>
	<script src="header.[hash].js"></script>
	<script src="menu.[hash].js"></script>
	<script src="body.[hash].js"></script>

# Implementation

# An other solution

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>A big ball of fronted</title>
  <link href="index.[hash].css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>

<body>
	<div id="header"></div>
	<div id="menu"></div>
	<div id="body"></div>
	<script src="index.[hash].js"></script>

# Frontend api's

.left-code[
Calling directly

```js
if (window.menu) {
	window.menu.addFavorite(
		'project planning'
	)
}
```
]

.right-code[
Message passing

```js
function listener(action) {
	//
}
window.addListener(listener);

message = {
	type: "FAVORITE_CREATED",
	payload: 'project planning'
}
window.dispatch(message)

```
]

???

Message passing similar to redux

Advantages of one vs the other?

# Routing

* Clear responsibiltities (only one app can should be able to control the route)
* Routing application - via api


???

History api can be enough
One responsibility
If you can do only fronted

---

# Shared components?

* form elements
* datePicker
* modal

???

Some options:
* hosted bootstrap library on a cdn
* a component library (think npm - problems when you want to use many different

---

# Loaded applications

* Not every application is loaded up front
* You are not on the backend

???

On the backend you can more or less rely on the fact the a service is available
What if you

Scenario: in project planning, you want to create a new invoice.
Possible solutions: 
* every applications loads a lazy loader that can react on messages
* all messages go to the backend as well. 

You don't want to load all applications at the same time
Neither do we want to use webpack to create bundles for all lazy loading (each team must be independent)
But what should we do then?

# Things that I haven't explored yet

* Search engines
* Server side rendering
* Different versions/deployment

???

* Watch out, you're running a distributed system
