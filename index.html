# A story about frontend development

Can we use the lessons learned from backend development on the frontend?

[Thomas Coopman @tcoopman](https://www.twitter.com/tcoopman)

[Infinite Tree](https://infinitetree.eu)

???

Using the lessons learned in backend development (services, microservices, decoupled)
What are reasons for services (scaling, not having the bbom, )

# Disclaimer

???

I have created and implemented some of these things,
Not all ideas are tested in production
There is no one correct solution
Experiment, test on your own, be critical

---

# First things First

## I will talk about Single Page Applications (SPA)

## But! 

???

Remark about SPA's. You don't have to build a SPA
Reasons why you would not want to build one:

* What is your reason to build a SPA?
* Techniques like turbolinks can make it fast
* Building a SPA has a cost (everything needs server side validation and if you don't build an api...)

---

# So you do want to build a SPA?

Your backend is full of (micro)services. And your frontend is one big ball of mud?
Was that your goal?

# Why it could be a bad idea to build a big ball of frontend

Are you ready to bet on one framework
A lot are missing (elm, bucklescript, reason)

---

# Techniques to prevent this

Split your SPA in apps
Every app has it's own responsibility
Every app can host an API
An app doesn't have to be frontend either, it can be mvc,php,whatever, it doesn't matter
